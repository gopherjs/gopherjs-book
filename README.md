# GopherJS by Example

_Build client side apps with the language you already trust on the backend._

GopherJS compiles [Go code](golang.org) to pure JavaScript code. Its main purpose is to give you the opportunity to write front-end code in Go which will still run in all browsers.

## Development

This book is being developed using [gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

```bash
npm install gitbook -g
gitbook serve .
```

Since gitbook supports plugins, we are able to embed the playground, interactive examples, and exercises inline with the prose.

## Contributing

This book has been written by various GopherJS contributors:
