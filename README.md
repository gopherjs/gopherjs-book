# GopherJS by Example

Welcome to the book!

## Development

This book is being developed using [gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

```bash
npm install gitbook -g
gitbook serve .
```

Since gitbook supports plugins, we will be able to embed the playground, interactive examples, and exercises inline with the prose. Gitbook also supports custom themes, so we can match the style of the website and branding.

## Contributing

Please use Github issues to discuss new chapters. That way we can plan a cohesive flow and avoid duplicate work.
