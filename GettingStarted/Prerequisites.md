#Prerequisites

The software requirements for this book are minimal: the first chapter will guide you through setting up a development environment from scratch, and the tools we will use are available in the standard repositories of most modern operating systems.

The GopherJS compiler can be installed like any other Go package, and we will walk through this process in the next chapter.
